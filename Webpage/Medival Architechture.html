<h1>Medival Architechture</h1>
<p>The medieval period was almost as dark in architecture as it was in other aspects. The first things that pop into 
    your mind when you think of the Middle Ages must be the wars and the crusades, and it’s quite obvious that most 
    of the architecture that survived all the following years is the kind that was used for defense. You will rarely 
    come across the civic architecture from the medieval times today, but you will get a chance to see a castle or a 
    fortress from the early Middle Ages here and there. However, in the late Middle Ages, three styles historically 
    classified as “medieval” appeared successively: the Pre-Romanesque, Romanesque and Gothic architecture, all of which 
    had roots in Europe. The Romanesque style was the first pan-European style since Roman architecture, and it was 
    followed by the elegant Gothic style, a fine crossover between the dark era and the Renaissance. Gothic architecture 
    was mostly nourished in France, and during this period, the potential of the arch and the vault was mastered, both in 
    terms of aesthetics and technology.</p>
<h3>The Renaissance</h3>
<p>Finally, in the early 15th century in Italy, which never truly adopted the Gothic style in its entirety, the 
    Renaissance introduced new ways of looking at reality, and most of it was mediated through architecture. It was the 
    period in which perspective was acknowledged (although it seemed that the Greeks were aware of it as well), studied 
    and understood as a new way of “achieving infinity”, as a point in which two parallel lines paradoxically meet. 
    This was studiously practiced through painting, but it was nonetheless embodied in architectural structures. Hence, 
    an emphasis was placed on symmetry and proportion, and how they affect human vision, as well as how they shape our 
    perception. Finally, the Renaissance meant reassessing classical antiquity and associating mathematics with aesthetics, 
    which enhanced the discipline and connected the dots that were needed to re-establish architecture as an all-encompassing 
    profession. So, besides having left a vast number of impressive buildings behind (mostly in Italy, specifically Florence), 
    the Renaissance gave impetus to the theoretical advancements that happened in the following years, decades, even centuries. 
    The architect considered to be the father of Renaissance is Filippo Brunelleschi, especially due to his contribution to architectural 
    theory, closely followed by Michelozzo Michelozzi and Leon Batista Alberti.</p>
<h3>Baroque Architecture</h3>
<p>After the Renaissance had been firmly established in Italy and spread across the rest of Europe (in each country in a slightly 
    different manner), it was gradually succeeded by the Baroque in the early 17th century. The Renaissance was characterized by 
    symmetrical plans and facades, pillars and pilasters that adhered to the interior spatial organization, and a general concern 
    with order and mathematical logic. On the other hand, the Baroque style promoted a more diversified, free approach to architectural 
    design, driven by playfulness rather than rationalism. It was typified by the fragmentary ornamental elements (especially on the façade), 
    plans that were not necessarily symmetrical, and a general lack of correspondence between the interior and the exterior of a building. If 
    the Renaissance was the truth, the Baroque was the drama; the Renaissance was realistic depiction and the Baroque was trompe l’oeil; the Renaissance 
    was a circle, the Baroque was an oval (literally – if you take a look at the plans, this is what you’ll notice). The best way to see the main buildings 
    from this part of history is simply to go to Rome, as it is basically the home of Baroque.</p>
