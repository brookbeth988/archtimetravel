                <h1>Neoclassicism</h1>
                <P>In the next few centuries, the 18th and the 19th, it seemed that the art world was put on pause, 
                    or even sort of rewound to its previous stages. A deliberate effort was made to return to classicism,
                     which resulted in the emergence of neo-classical architecture and a series of revivals â€“ Romanesque 
                     revival, Gothic revival, and a sort of American Neo-Classicism that is usually referred to as the 
                     Federal Style Architecture. This is what sometimes makes you question the period in which a building 
                     was made, especially if you don't have any insight into its construction. This sort of regression was 
                     not overcome until the late 19th century, when Art Nouveau emerged as a new total style, and finally 
                     opened a gap for breaking with tradition. Much of the credit goes to the Industrial Revolution as well, 
                     which made the mass production of iron possible and revolutionized the process of construction and building 
                     at large.</P>
