<h1>Greek and Roman Architechture</h1>
<h3>Greek Architechture</h3>
<p>The society of ancient Greece was the one to introduce the concept of public spaces, with the advent of the public 
    square called agora. Placing an emphasis on civic life, the ancient Greek architecture was born of democracy and 
    devoted to the people. The temple was part of the agora and although monumental, its character was open and the 
    program was inverted – the rituals were carried out outside the temple. Instead of securing their temples with massive 
    stone walls, the Greeks used columns and canopies. Interestingly, the Greeks designed them so that they would “correct” 
    the distortion of human vision. They were the first ones to notice the incapability of our eyes to perceive objects as 
    they truly are, and to use this as an input for architectural design, as they introduced the entasis (the intentional 
    curvature of all lines on a temple). The curvature, paradoxically, helped the human eye see the temple as if it were 
    straight.</p>
<h3>Roman Architechture</h3>
<p>After the Romans had conquered the Greek territories, they virtually took over and strongly influenced most of the 
    Western architecture over the next centuries. While greatly inspired (in lack of a better word) by Greek architecture, 
    the Romans introduced quite a few immense innovations themselves – the arch, an eminent architectural element that you 
    wouldn’t believe was not used before the Romans mastered it (the Etruscans came up with the concept though), and concrete, 
    although it was a bit different from the material we use extensively today. The rest is, literally, history – it was 
    finally possible to build the dome and to work with different types of arcades, helping the Romans make their aqueducts
    and triumphal gates.</p>
<h3>Byzantine Architecture</h3>
<p>Furthermore, the evolution of architecture continued as the ancient Roman architecture served as a starting point for 
    the Byzantine architecture, which gained independence once the Eastern Roman empire separated from Rome and 
    established a capital in Constantinople (then known as Byzantium, on the territory of today’s Istanbul). One of its 
    main contributions is the further development of the dome, since they found a way to raise it on piers, using the 
    three-dimensional triangular surfaces called pendentives. This means that it was no longer necessary for the dome to 
    have a massive support beneath it (and if you think of it, most of the domes you see today sort of “float” above you). 
    However, although it has made a major impact on European architecture, this architectural style is now best known for 
    its transformation into the Ottoman Empire architecture, once the Byzantine territories were defeated by the Turks in 
    the 15th century. Consequently, the building style started reflecting the Islamic sensibility and gave rise to a new 
    kind of architecture.</p>
