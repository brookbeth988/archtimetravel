<h1>Modern and Contemporary Architechture</h1>
<h3>Modern Architechture</h3>
<p>Many important things happened on the verge of the 19th century, both for the arts and architecture. 
    Art Nouveau is widely seen as the first step toward Modernism, which made it crystal clear that we 
    are done with classical architecture. This is due to a number of reasons, but it is appropriately 
    illustrated by a single sentence signed by Louis Sullivan (the “father” of skyscrapers and inherently 
    related to Art Nouveau): Form follows function. Modern (or Modernist) architecture literally turned the 
    entire context of architectural design upside-down. Coinciding with some of the major cultural movements, 
    such as the Bauhaus and De Stijl, it introduced functionalism and purified architectural form to the most 
    radical extremes. It is possible to argue that it was simultaneously liberating and imprisoning, having made 
    the architecture free (of ornament), and confined (by the universal language). Despite the latter and the fact 
    that its scope is still quite vague even from today’s point of view, modernism came as one of the most important 
    shifts in architectural design and expression. Its significance lies in the fact that it continues to inspire 
    architects today, both in a good and a bad way, and of course, because it was able to evoke a critical response 
    – postmodernism.</p>
    <h3>Contemporary Architechture</h3>
    <p>The contemporary always seems to be shifting forward, thus writing about the present in a historical context 
        seems tricky. If you take a look at the way architects approach design today, you'll find several different 
        responses. Some of them are neo-modern (as we have entered the phase that is very distant from the modern period, 
        so this revival is possible), some still remind us of post-modernism, and some we are not sure how to call 
        - deconstructivism, perhaps, or parametricism as a possibly new type of universal language, or something else, 
        that hasn't been named yet. Technological improvements, especially computer programs but also the ones that are 
        directly related to construction, make almost everything seem possible. The only relevant parameter is the cost, 
        and of course, ethics. But as mentioned earlier, architecture rarely escapes the imprints of the era it is being 
        built in, and whatever becomes out of it in the next few decades, it will be the echo of our generation. Another 
        possible way of looking at it is adopting the idea that history reoccurs, which would mean that postmodernism was 
        the contemporary version of the Baroque, and we are much likely to return to the new revivals.</p>
