                <h1>Brief History of Architecture</h1>
                <p>The history of architecture is about as long as the history of humanity itself, 
                    and probably just as complex. The exact origin of architecture could be said to date to 
                    the Neolithic period (around 10,000 BC) or simply when people stopped living in caves and 
                    started handling the way they want their houses to look and feel like. The architecture that we’re talking 
                    about today is commonly assessed through visual terms and subject to ocular perception, but this urge to design 
                    an architectural artefact was fueled by much more than the mere need for aesthetic appeal. Architecture has proven 
                    to be many things – comfy, elegant, modern, brutal, indexical, vernacular – and yet, one of its most interesting 
                    aspects is its capacity to reflect the spirit of time, in a way that might be even more substantial than how we see 
                    it happen with art. The parallelism of history od architecture to human history is justified by its strong material 
                    presence that serves as the best physical evidence of societal change. Just looking at the buildings made in different 
                    places at a different moment in time would help us understand the evolution of architecture and our past without using 
                    any words.</p>

                <h3>A Global History of Architecture</h3> 
                <p>So if Churchill was right about history being written by the victors, history of architecture and art is not exempt 
                    from that rule. The old buildings that we’re able to see and document today are the ones that belonged to the most 
                    developed and powerful societies, and those that survived the millennia are there to tell us just how carefully they 
                    were watched over. The main highights of Architectural History include:</p>
