                <h1>The Ziggurat and the Pyramids</h1>
                <p>When talking about architectural history in chronological order, one usually starts from the ziggurat, as it 
                    is one of the most symbolic built structures from our past. This is partly thanks to the Tower of Babel, a
                    myth that has nonetheless been associated with existing structures (a ziggurat dedicated to the Mesopotamian
                    god Marduk). The massive, terraced structures were built in Mesopotamia for ritual purposes, and they are
                    considered to be the typological predecessors of the “real” pyramids. As the structure was stepped and
                    successively receding toward the sky, the ziggurat (or the step pyramid) was often interpreted as a link 
                    between the earth and the sky, the way our ancestors saw it. However, in practical terms, its fortress-like 
                    structure was ideal for protection, and also for escaping the rising levels of water. <br/> The Egyptians were also 
                    building the step pyramids at first. However, the form of the Egyptian tomb had progressed, and the three pyramids in
                    Giza exemplify their upgraded appearance, the one they acquired during the Fourth Dynasty – with smooth sides, which 
                    people still tend to admire to this day. Finally, stepped pyramids were found in Mayan and other Mesoamerican architecture 
                    as well, as their temples were typologically reminiscent of the Mesopotamian ones (even though they were built much later).
